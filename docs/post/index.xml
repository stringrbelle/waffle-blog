      <description>this section is written in markdown. it is used primarily for discussion, explanation etc. first let’s load our packages
library(tidyverse) library(slumdown) this would usually be about waffles, but instead i will do something boring with cars and the mpg data frame. oh and i will also illutrate the use of inline R coomands 7
pic &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + theme_slum(palette = &amp;quot;kunoichi&amp;quot;) + xlab(&amp;quot;Engine Displacement&amp;quot;) + ylab(&amp;quot;Highway Mileage&amp;quot;) this chunk has created the pic variable.</description>

      <description>Like any blogdown post, a slumdown post is written in R Markdown, and uses a few custom fields in the YAML field. This tutorial provides an illustration of how different kinds of content are displayed.</description>

      <title>Tutorial part 3: Colour palettes in slumdown</title>
      <link>/post/colour-palettes/</link>

      <guid>/post/colour-palettes/</guid>
      <description>The main reason I wrote slumdown (besides boredom) was to make it easy to  include user-defined colours palettes in blogdown, and expose those palettes to R so that (for instance) plots can be drawn in a style that matches the blog style. This tutorial introduces this palette system.</description>

      <description>Slumdown allows the user to control the background image at the top of each post, the profile image overlaid in the middle of that image, and the caption attached to the header image. This post describes how this is done.</description>

      <title>Tutorial part 5: Deploying to GitHub</title>

      <guid>/post/deploying-to-github/</guid>
      <description>This tutorial describes how to deploy a site. Blogdown sites are very often deployed to Netlify, but I have a personal bias to use GitHub Pages, so &lt;em&gt;slumdown&lt;/em&gt; is configured by default to use GitHub.</description>
