this section is written in markdown. it is used primarily for discussion, explanation etc. first let's load our packages

```{r packageload, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(slumdown)
```

this would usually be about waffles, but instead i will do something boring with cars and the `mpg` data frame. oh and i will also illutrate the use of inline R coomands `r 1+6` 

```{r picture}
pic <- ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  theme_slum(palette = "kunoichi") + 
  xlab("Engine Displacement") + 
  ylab("Highway Mileage")
```

this chunk has created the `pic` variable. to draw the plot, we just include the R command `print(pic)`

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
print(pic)
```
